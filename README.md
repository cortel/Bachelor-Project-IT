Drone Survey System is a software that is created with the purpose of optimizing efficiency among farmers in Denmark. The main objective of this project is to provide the farmers with tools that can enable an objective forecast regarding the healthiness of crops, as well as to identify any actions that should be performed to optimize the amount or size of the harvest. This is done by using drones for surveillance of the fields and having a user interface to initiate this process and check upon its results. Aside this aspect, the main technical choices revolve around having a System of Systems Architecture, which has at its core two components: the drone with its control modules and a 3-tier system which provides an interface for the user. The result is a scalable and adaptable solution that meets all the requirements that were posed and reaches all the objectives of the project.
